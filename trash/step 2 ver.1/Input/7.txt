Start by putting your tenderloins in the slow cooker. Pour the beer on them and put the slow cooker on high for 6 to 8 hours.
When the meat is ready, turn off the slow cooker and transfer the meat to a carving board and pull the meat apart with 2 forks to create pulled pork. Take out any pieces of fat from the slow cooker and put the pork back in it's juices and cover.
Heat up your oven to 400 degrees F.
In a small saucepan, heat milk, water and butter until very warm, 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). Transfer into a bowl, sprinkle the yeast on top and let it sit for 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 3/4 cup flour, sugar and salt. Mix milk mixture into flour mixture, and then mix in egg. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Divide dough into 24 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly. Cover, and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
While the buns are cooling a bit, mix in your BBQ sauce with your pork.
Slice your slider buns in half, put a bit of the pork, a bit of cheese (a strong cheddar would be good) and a bit of cilantro.
Enjoy!

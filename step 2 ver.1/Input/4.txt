Peel the kiwifruit and dice into pieces approximately 1/2 inch.
Peel the mango and cut into pieces the same size as the kiwi.
Cut up cucumbers in pieces the same size as kiwifruit and mango. I had small cucumbers with thin skins, but if you're using larger cucumbers I would peel or partially peel them.
Thinly slice the green onions.
Mix fresh squeezed lime juice with just a touch of green Tabasco sauce, or you could use a couple of small jalapenos, finely diced if you don't have the green Tabasco.
Mix all the ingredients together and it's done. You can chill for a few hours, or serve at room temperature.

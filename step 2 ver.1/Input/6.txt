Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. 
Using a knife, remove the thick inner stems from the leaves, leaving long strips; cut the strips in half. Arrange the leaves dark side up in a single layer on two baking sheets. 
Lightly mist each piece with olive oil spray. Sprinkle generously and evenly with Parmesan cheese. 
Bake about 14-16 minutes, until the leaves are crisp and the cheese is lightly golden. Sometimes the leaves bake unevenly, so watch them carefully, removing the crisp ones as they are done and returning the others to continue baking until done. Serve warm.

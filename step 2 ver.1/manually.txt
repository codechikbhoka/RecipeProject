Start by putting your *tenderloins* in the slow cooker. Pour the *beer* on them and put the slow cooker on high for 6 to 8 hours.
When the meat is ready, turn off the slow cooker and transfer the meat to a carving board and pull the meat apart with 2 forks to create pulled pork. Take out any pieces of fat from the slow cooker and put the pork back in it's juices and cover.
Heat up your oven to 400 degrees F.
In a small saucepan, heat *milk*, *water* and *butter* until very warm, 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). Transfer into a bowl, sprinkle the *yeast* on top and let it sit for 10 minutes.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 3/4 cup *flour*, *sugar* and *salt*. Mix *milk* mixture into *flour* mixture, and then mix in *egg*. Stir in the remaining *flour*, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition.
When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
Divide dough into 24 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly. Cover, and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes.
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
While the buns are cooling a bit, mix in your *BBQ sauce* with your pork.
Slice your slider buns in half, put a bit of the pork, a bit of *cheese* (a strong cheddar would be good) and a bit of *cilantro*.
Enjoy!





1. Combine first 3 ingredients in a large zip-top plastic bag; add *fish*. Seal and marinate in refrigerator 3 hours.
2. Preheat grill or grill pan to medium-high heat.
3. Remove *fish* from bag, reserving the *marinade*. Pour *marinade* into a small saucepan; bring to a boil. Cook until reduced to 2 tablespoons (about 5 minutes).
4. Place fish on grill rack or pan coated with cooking spray; grill 4 minutes on each side or until fish flakes easily when tested with a fork or until desired degree of doneness, basting occasionally with marinade. Remove fish from grill; sprinkle with *salt* and *pepper*.






1 In a large bowl, mix *peaches*, 2/3 cup *sugar*, and the *tapioca*, *lemon* peel, *lemon* juice, and *vanilla*. Let stand at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes to soften the *tapioca*, stirring several times.
2 In another bowl, combine *flour* with remaining 1/3 cup *sugar*, the *baking powder*, and *nutmeg*. With a pastry blender or your fingers, incorporate *butter* into *flour* mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add *cream* and stir just until dough holds together.
3 In a buttered shallow 2 1/2 to 3 quart baking dish, spread fruit level. Using your hands, crumble dough evenly over fruit.
4 Bake in 350Â°F oven until fruit mixture bubbles in center and topping is golden brown, 50-60 minutes.






Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. 
Using a knife, remove the thick inner stems from the leaves, leaving long strips; cut the strips in half. Arrange the leaves dark side up in a single layer on two baking sheets. 
Lightly mist each piece with *olive oil* spray. Sprinkle generously and evenly with *Parmesan cheese*. 
Bake about 14-16 minutes, until the leaves are crisp and the *cheese* is lightly golden. Sometimes the leaves bake unevenly, so watch them carefully, removing the crisp ones as they are done and returning the others to continue baking until done. Serve warm.




Heat *oil* in a 10-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat until hot but not smoking. Add *carrots* and *saut*, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Add *pomegranate* juice, *cinnamon* stick, *salt*, and *pepper* and *simmer*, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until *carrots* are tender and liquid is reduced to a glaze, 20 to 25 minutes. Add *coriander seeds* and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Discard *cinnamon stick* and serve *carrots* hot or at room temperature.




Heat oil in a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add *carrots* and *cook*, stirring frequently, 4 minutes. Stir in *ginger* and *sugar* and cook, stirring, until *sugar* melts, about 2 minutes. Add *pecans* and cook until *carrots* are tender when pierced and mixture is glazed in sugar, 3 to 5 minutes.
Note: Nutritional analysis is per 1/2-cup serving.




In a large saucepan, heat the *oil* over medium-high heat. Add the *rice* and stir to coat with the *oil*. Add the *coconut milk*, *water*, and *salt*; bring to a boil. Stir in the *mango*. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed.
Remove the *rice* from the heat and fluff with a fork. Place a clean, dry dish towel over the pan, cover with the lid, and let steam for 5 minutes before serving.




Peel the *kiwifruit* and dice into pieces approximately 1/2 inch.
Peel the *mango* and cut into pieces the same size as the kiwi.
Cut up *cucumbers* in pieces the same size as *kiwifruit* and *mango*. I had small *cucumbers* with thin skins, but if you're using larger *cucumbers* I would peel or partially peel them.
Thinly slice the *green onions*.
Mix fresh squeezed *lime juice* with just a touch of green *Tabasco sauce*, or you could use a couple of small *jalapenos*, finely diced if you don't have the green Tabasco.
Mix all the ingredients together and it's done. You can chill for a few hours, or serve at room temperature.




Liquidise 1 of the *onions* with the *garlic*, *pepper*, *salt*, *coriander* and *turmeric*.
In a pan melt the *ghee* and fry the remaining *onion* till golden. Add the liquidised *onion* mix and cook for 5 minutes.
Cut the *okra* in half crossways, gently add this to the pot so as not to break them up too much. Cover the pot and cook on low heat for 20 minutes.
Add the *tomatoes*, *mint* and *garam masala* and cook for another 15 minutes.



Cut the *eggplants* into 1-inch pieces- preferably keeping at least one side of each piece with the skin on.
Put the *eggplant* pieces into a strainer and sprinkle liberally with *salt*. Place a small plate on top of the *eggplant*, and a weight on top of the plate- this process draws the excess water out of the eggplant, and it won't be overly salty. Leave for at least 30 minutes.
Heat 1 1/2 *tbsp* oil in a heavy pan. When hot, add *mustard seeds*- they will start to pop in a few seconds. When they begin to pop, add the *sliced onions*, *garlic* and *ginger*. Turn the heat to medium, and cook until mixture is nicely browned.
Add *cayenne pepper*, *tumeric*, *garam masala* and *cumin* to the onion mixture. Cook *spices* for a few minutes, then add *water* and *tomato paste*, and reduce heat to low. Let the sauce cook gently, but don't allow it to become dry.
In a large skillet, heat 1 1/2 *tbsp oil* over moderate heat. Add *eggplant* pieces to the pan, and arrange in a single layer. Saute until all sides are brown and crisp.
Once all *eggplant* pieces are browned, incorporate them into the sauce pan, making sure to cover all pieces with the sauce. Add *lemon juice* and *salt*.
Cook gently until *eggplant* is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes). Stir occasionally (and very gently) and serve.

2 Preserve some cut pieces 1 cup) of onion.

3 Cut small pieces of tomatoes.

4 Make small pieces of fish fillets, about 3 inches in length.

5 Clean them properly if you are using the whole fish and make it into small pieces.

6 Take a big plate, put the fish in it and sprinkle 2 teaspoon of salt, two teaspoon of turmeric powder and the garlic paste.

7 Mix all of them properly.

8 Allow to marinate for 1/2 hour.

9 Take a pan or a wok (preferable), heat it and put oil to deep fry the fish.

10 Once the oil is much hotter, fry the fish, 3-4 pieces at a time, 3-4 minutes on each side.

11 Keep all of them in a separate plate.

12 When all the pieces are fried, clean all the black residues from the oil in the wok with the spatula and put 2 tablespoon of fresh oil in the it.

14 Then put the cut onion pieces and allow it to just a little brown.

15 Then put all the ground paste, tomatoes, left over turmeric powder and salt to taste.

16 Keep stirring it until the paste becomes a little brown (it takes around 10 minutes).

17 You can also identify it by looking at the wok, that the paste will start leaving the oil and paste will now no more stick on the wok.

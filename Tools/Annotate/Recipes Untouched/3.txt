1 In a large bowl, mix peaches, 2/3 cup sugar, and the tapioca, lemon peel, lemon juice, and vanilla. Let stand at least 15 minutes or up to 30 minutes to soften the tapioca, stirring several times.
2 In another bowl, combine flour with remaining 1/3 cup sugar, the baking powder, and nutmeg. With a pastry blender or your fingers, incorporate butter into flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add cream and stir just until dough holds together.
3 In a buttered shallow 2 1/2 to 3 quart baking dish, spread fruit level. Using your hands, crumble dough evenly over fruit.
4 Bake in 350Â°F oven until fruit mixture bubbles in center and topping is golden brown, 50-60 minutes.

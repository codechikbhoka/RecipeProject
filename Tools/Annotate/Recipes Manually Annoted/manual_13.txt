1 In a <U>grinder</U> <CA>grind</CA> the <I>onions,</I> <I>ginger,</I> 2 <I>bay leaves,</I> <I>red chili,</I> <I>mustard seeds,</I> <I>cumin seed</I> all together. 

2 <CA>Preserve</CA> some cut pieces 1 cup) of <I>onion.</I> 

3 <CA>Cut</CA> small pieces of <I>tomatoes.</I> 

4 <CA>Make</CA> small pieces of <I>fish fillets,</I> about 3 inches in length. 

5 <CA>Cleanx</CA> them properly if you are using the whole <I>fish</I> and <CA>make</CA> it into small pieces. 

6 <CA>Take</CA> a big <U>plate,/<U> <CA>put</CA> the <I>fish</I> in it and <CA>sprinkle</CA> 2 teaspoon of <I>salt,</i> two teaspoon of <I>turmeric powder</I> and the <I>garlic paste.</I> 

7 <CA>Mix<CA/> all of them properly. 

8 Allow to <CA>marinate</CA> for 1/2 hour. 

9 Take a <U>pan</U> or a <U>wok</U> (preferable), <CA>heat</CA> it and <CA><CA>put</CA></CA> <I>oil</I> to deep <CA>fry</CA> the <I>fish.</I> 

10 Once the <I>oil</I> is much hotter, <CA>fry</CA> the <I>fish,</I> 3-4 pieces at a time, 3-4 minutes on each side. 

11 <CA>Keep</CA> all of them in a separate <U>plate.</U> 

12 When all the pieces are fried, <CA>clean</CA> all the black residues from the <I>oil</I> in the <U>wok</U> with the <U>spatula</U> and <CA>put</CA> 2 tablespoon of fresh <I>oil</I> in the it.

16 Keep <CA>stirring</CA> it until the <iI>paste</iI> becomes a little brown (it takes around 10 minutes). 

17 You can also identify it by looking at the <U>wok,</U> that the <iI>paste<iI> will start leaving the <I>oil</I> and <iI>paste</iI> will now no more stick on the <U>wok.</U> 

18 The <iI>paste</iI> is now perfectly fried. 

19 Now <CA>pour</CA> 3 cups of <I>water</I> to it, or as much thick <iI>gravy</iI> you want. 

20 Once the <iI>gravy</iI> comes to <CA>boil,</CA> start <CA>dropping</CA> the fried <I>fish</I> pieces and allow to <CA>boil</CA> for 15 minutes.

In the large <U>bowl</U> of a heavy duty <u>electric mixer</U> (such as a Kitchen Aid), <CA>add</CA> the warm <I>water.</I> <CA>Sprinkle</CA> on the <I>yeast</I> and let <CA>sit</CA> for 5 minutes until the <I>yeast</I> is <CA>dissolved.</CA> <CA>Stir</CA> to <CA>dissolve</CA> completely if needed at the end of 5 minutes. 
<CA>Attach</CA> a <U>mixing paddle</U> to the <U>mixer</U>. <CA>Mix</CA> in the <I>olive oil,</I> <I>flour,</I> <I>salt</I> and <I>sugar</I> on low speed for about a minute. <CA>Remove</CA> the <U>mixing paddle</U> and <CA>replace</CA> with a <U>dough hook.</U> <CA>Knead</CA> using the <U>mixer</U> and <U>dough hook,</U> on low to medium speed, until the <I>dough</I> is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. If you don't have a mixer, you can <CA>mix</CA> and <CA>knead</CA> by hand. If the <I>dough</I> seems a little too wet, <CA>sprinkle</CA> on a bit more <I>flour.</I> 
Place ball of <I>dough</I> in a <U>bowl</U> that has been coated lightly with <I>olive oil.</I> <CA>Turn</CA> the <I>dough</I> around in the <U>bowl</U> so that it gets coated with the <I>oil.</I> <CA>Cover</CA> with <U>plastic wrap.</U> Let <CA>sit</CA> in a warm place (75-85°F) until it doubles in size, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours (or several hours longer, a longer rise will improve the flavor). If you don't have a warm spot in the house you can <CA>heat</CA> the <U>oven</U> to 150 degrees, and then <CA>turn off</CA> the <U>oven.</U> Let the <U>oven</U> <CA>cool</CA> till it is just a little warm, then <CA>place</CA> the <U>bowl</U> of <iI>dough</iI> in this warmed <U>oven</U> to rise. 
At this point, if you want to make ahead, you can <CA>freeze</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> in an <U>airtight container</U> for up to two weeks. 
Place a <I>pizza stone</I> on a <U>rack</U> in the lower third of your <U>oven</U>. <CA>Preheat</CA> the <U>oven</U> to 450°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. 
<CA>Remove</CA> the <U>plastic cover</U> from the <iI>dough</iI> and <CA>punch</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> down so it deflates a bit. <CA>Divide</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> in half. <CA>Form</CA> two round balls of <iI>dough.</iI> <CA>Place</CA> each in its own <U>bowl</U>, <CA>cover</CA> with <U>plastic</U> and let <CA>sit</CA> for 10 minutes. 
<CA>Prepare</CA> your desired <I>toppings</I>. Note that you are not going to want to <CA>load up</CA> each <iI>pizza</iI> with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a third a cup each of <I>tomato sauce</I> and <I>cheese</I> would be sufficient for one <iI>pizza</iI>. One to two <I>mushrooms</I> thinly sliced will cover a <iI>pizza</iI>. 
<CA>Working</CA> one ball of <iI>dough</iI> at a time, take one ball of <iI>dough</iI> and <CA>flatten</CA> it with your hands on a slightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your <U>fingertips</U> to <CA>press</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> to 1/2-inch thick. <CA>Turn</CA> and <CA>stretch</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> until it will not stretch further. Let the <iI>dough</iI> <CA>relax</CA> 5 minutes and then continue to <CA>stretch</CA> it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches. Use your palm to <CA>flatten</CA> the edge of the <iI>dough</iI> where it is thicker. You can <CA>pinch</CA> the very edges if you want to form a lip. 
<CA>Brush</CA> the top of the <iI>dough</iI> with <I>olive oil</I> (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Use your <U>finger tips</U> to <CA>press down</CA> and <CA>make dents</CA> along the surface of the <iI>dough</iI> to prevent bubbling. Let <CA>rest</CA> another 5 minutes. 
<CA>Repeat</CA> with the second ball of <iI>dough.</iI> 
Lightly <CA>sprinkle</CA> your <iI>pizza peel</iI> (or flat baking sheet) with <I>corn meal</I>. <CA>Transfer</CA> one prepared flattened <iI>dough</iI> to the pizza <iI>peel</iI>. If the <iI>dough</iI> has lost its shape in the transfer, lightly <CA>shape</CA> it to the desired dimensions. 
<CA>Spoon</CA> on the <I>tomato sauce</I>, <CA>sprinkle</CA> with <I>cheese</I>, and <CA>place</CA> your desired <I>toppings</I> on the <iI>pizza.</iI> 
<CA>Sprinkle</CA> some <I>cornmeal</I> on the <iI>baking stone</iI> in the <U>oven</U> (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently <CA>shake</CA> the <iI>peel</iI> to see if the <iI>dough</iI> will easily <CA>slide,</CA> if not, gently <CA>lift</CA> up the edges of the <iI>pizza</iI> and <CA>add</CA> a bit more <I>cornmeal.</I> <CA>Slide</CA> the <iI>pizza</iI> off of the <iI>peel</iI> and on to the <iI>baking stone</iI> in the <U>oven.</U> <CA>Bake</CA> <iI>pizza</iI> one at a time until the crust is browned and the <iI>cheese</iI> is golden, about 10-15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can <CA>sprinkle</CA> on a little more <I>cheese</I>.

Start by putting your <I>tenderloins</I> in the slow <U>cooker.</U> <CA>Pour</CA> the <I>beer</I> on them and put the slow <CA>cooker</CA> on high for 6 to 8 hours. 
When the <iI>meat</iI> is ready, turn off the slow <U>cooker</U> and <CA>transfer</CA> the <iI>meat</iI> to a <U>carving board</U> and pull the <iI>meat</iI> apart with 2 <U>forks</U> to create <iI>pulled pork.</iI> <CA>Take</CA> out any pieces of <iI>fat</iI> from the slow <U>cooker</U> and <CA>put</CA> the <iI>pork</iI> back in it's <iI>juices</iI> and <CA>cover.</CA> 
<CA>Heat</CA> up your <U>oven</U> to 400 degrees F. 
In a small <U>saucepan,</U> <CA>heat</CA> <I>milk,</I> <I>water</I> and <I>butter</I> until very warm, 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). <CA>Transfer</CA> into a <U>bowl,</U> <CA>sprinkle</CA> the <I>yeast</I> on top and let it sit for 10 minutes. 
In a large <U>bowl,</U> <CA>mix</CA> together 1 3/4 cup <I>flour,</I> <I>sugar</I> and <I>salt.</I> <CA>Mix</CA> <iI>milk mixture</iI> into <iI>flour mixture,</iI> and then <CA>mix</CA> in <I>egg.</I> <CA>Stir</CA> in the remaining <iI>flour,</iI> 1/2 cup at a time, <CA>beating</CA> well after each <CA>addition.</CA> 
When the <iI>dough</iI> has pulled together, <CA>turn it out</CA> onto a lightly floured surface, and <CA>knead</CA> until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. 
<CA>Divide</CA> <iI>dough</iI> into 24 equal pieces. <CA>Shape</CA> into smooth balls, and <CA>place</CA> on a <U>greased baking sheet.</U> <CA>Flatten</CA> slightly. <CA>Cover,</CA> and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes. 
<CA>Bake</CA> at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 10 minutes, or until golden brown. 
While the <iI>buns</iI> are <CA>cooling</CA> a bit, <CA>mix</CA> in your BBQ sauce with your <iI>pork.</iI> 
<CA>Slice</CA> your <iI>slider buns</iI> in half, put a bit of the <iI>pork,</iI> a bit of <I>cheese</I> (a strong cheddar would be good) and a bit of <I>cilantro.</I> 
Enjoy!

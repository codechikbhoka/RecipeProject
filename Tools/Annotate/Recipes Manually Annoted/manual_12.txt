<CA>Sieve</CA> the <I>flour.</I> 
<CA>Rub</CA> 1 tablespoon of <I>margarine</I> very well into the <I>flour.</I> 
<CA>Make</CA> a well in the centre. <CA>Add</CA> the <I>salt</I> in this well and <CA>pour</CA> a little ice-cold <I>water</I> on top. 
<CA>Make</CA> a soft <iI>dough</iI> by <CA>adding</CA> some more ice-cold <I>water.</I> 
<CA>Knead</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> for 2 minutes. 
<CA>Keep</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> under a <U>cloth</U> for 10 minutes. 
<CA>Roll</CA> out the <iI>dough</iI> with the help of a little <I>flour</I> to a rectangular shape. <CA>Brush</CA> away the extra <I>flour.</I> 
<CA>Apply</CA> the remaining 115 grams of <I>margarine</I> leaving aside a strip of 12 mm. (1/2") width all around. 
<CA>Divide</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> into 4 imaginary equal parts as in picture. 
<CA>Fold</CA> part no.1 on the left on part no.2. 
Next <CA>fold</CA> part no.4 on the right on part no.3. 
Next <CA>fold</CA> part no.3 on part no.2. 
<CA>Sprinkle</CA> plenty of <I>flour</I> on a <U>tray.</U> <CA>Put</CA> the rolled <iI>dough</iI> over it and <CA>sprinkle</CA> <I>flour</I> again. <CA>cover</CA> with a <U>cloth.</U> 
<CA>Chill</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> in the freezer compartment of a <U>refrigerator</U> over the <U>ice tray</U> for 30 minutes. 
<CA>Remove</CA> from the <U>refrigerator</U> and <CA>roll out</CA> to a rectangular shape. 
<CA>Divide</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> into 3 imaginary equal parts as under. 
<CA>Fold</CA> part no.1 on the left on part no.2 and <CA>fold</CA> part no.3 on the right on part no.2. 
<CA>Chill</CA> the <iI>dough</iI> in the freezer compartment of a <U>refrigerator</U> over the <U>ice tray</U> for 15 minutes. 
<CA>Repeat</CA> steps 15, 16 and 17. 
<CA>Roll</CA> out the <iI>dough</iI> to about 6 mm. (1/4") thickness in the shape of rectangle. 
<CA>Cut</CA> into squares. 
<CA>Put</CA> a little <I>stuffing</I> in the centre of each squares and <CA>make</CA> a shape of triangle out of it by <CA>pressing</CA> together two opposite diagonal corners. 
<CA>Arrange</CA> on a <U>baking dish.</U> <CA>Brush</CA> with ghee. 
<CA>Bake</CA> in a hot <U>oven</U> at 450°F for 15 minutes. 
<CA>Bake</CA> in hot <U>oven</U> at 450°F for 15 minutes. <CA>Reduce</CA> the temperature to 350°F and <CA>bake</CA> for a further 10 minutes. 
<CA>Serve</CA> hot.

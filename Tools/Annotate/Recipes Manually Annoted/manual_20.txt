<CA>Put</CA> a large <U>pot</U> of <I>salted water</I> (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the <U>stovetop</U> on high heat. It can take a while for a <U>large pot of water</U> to come to a <CA>boil</CA> (this will be your pasta water), so <CA>prepare</CA> the <I>sauce</I> in the next steps while the <I>water</I> is <CA>heating.</CA> 

<CA>Heat</CA> about a <U>teaspoon</U> or so of <I>olive oil</I> in a <U>large skillet</U> on medium high heat. <CA>Add</CA> the lean <I>ground beef</I> and <CA>cook</CA> it in the <U>skillet</CA> until lightly browned and cooked through. <CA>Put</CA> a few layers of <U>paper towels</U> in <U>large bowl.</U> With <U>slotted spoon,</U> <CA>remove</CA> the <iI>browned beef</iI> from the <U>skillet,</U> <CA>draining off</CA> the excess <iI>beef fat,</iI> and <CA>put</CA> the <iI>browned beef</iI> on top of the <U>paper towels</U> to help <CA>blot away</CA> the excess fat. After you have <CA>removed</CA> all the <iI>browned beef</iI> from the <U>skillet,</U> <CA>drain off</CA> and <CA>dispose</CA> of excess <I>fat.</I> (If your ground beef is sufficiently lean, there won't be any excess fat to drain.) 


<CA>Add</CA> the <I>diced bell pepper</I> and <I>onions</I> to <U>skillet</U> (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions). <CA>Brown</CA> for a few minutes on medium high heat. <CA>Add</CA> the minced <I>garlic</I> and <CA>cook</CA> for 30 seconds more. <CA>Add</CA> the <iI>browned beef</iI> back to the <U>skillet,</U> <CA>lower the heat</CA> to low and continue to <CA>cook</CA> for 5 more minutes <CA>stirring</CA> frequently. 


<CA>Transfer</CA> <iI>browned beef,</iI> <iI>bell peppers</iI> and <iI>onions</iI> to a medium sized (3 to 4 quart) <U>pot.</U> <CA>Add</CA> the <I>tomato sauce,</I> <I>tomato paste,</I> and <I>crushed tomatoes.</I> <CA>Add</CA> <I>oregano,</I> <I>parsley,</I> <I>Italian seasoning,</I> <CA>adjust</CA> amounts to taste. <CA>Add</CA> a pinch of <I>garlic powder</I> and/or a pinch of <I>garlic salt,</I> to taste. <CA>Add</CA> a splash of red or white wine <I>vinegar.</I> <CA>Add</CA> <I>sugar</I> a tablespoon at a time, until desired level of sweetness, no more than 1/4 cup of sugar. Note that it is hard to follow a pure recipe when it comes to pasta sauce. One Italian spice mix is not like the other, nor is one can of tomato sauce like another. So you really do need to taste the sauce as you are adding the spices, sugar and vinegar, and adjust for your preference. <CA>Add</CA> <I>salt</I> to taste, and note that you will later be adding <I>Parmesan,</I> which is salty. 

Bring the <iI>sauce</iI> to a <CA>simmer</CA> and <CA>lower</CA> the heat to low to maintain a <CA>low simmer</CA>. <CA>Cook</CA> for 15-45 minutes to thicken (do not scorch bottom, stir frequently). <CA>Remove</CA> from heat. 


By now the <iI>salted water</iI> you started heating in step one should be <CA>boiling.</CA> <CA>Add</CA> the dry lasagna noodles and <CA>cook</CA> then per package directions (al dente). (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.) <CA>Stir</CA> often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent <iI>noodles</iI> from sticking. When ready, <CA>drain</CA> in a <U>colander</U> and rinse with cool <I>water,</I> gently <CA>separating</CA> any noodles that may be sticking together. <CA>Spread</CA> a little <I>olive oil</I> on a large rimmed <U>baking sheet,</U> and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the <iI>olive oil.</iI> This will prevent them from sticking together. 


In a 13x9x2-inch <U>casserole</U> or <U>lasagna dish,</U> <CA>ladle</CA> one cup of <I>sauce</I> and <CA>spread</CA> it along the bottom of the <U>pan.</U> <CA>Apply</CA> one layer noodles 3 length wise (edge may overlap, depending on your pan). <CA>Ladle</CA> a third of the remaining <iI>sauce</iI> over the <iI>noodles.<iI> <CA>Apply</CA> a layer of a third of the <I>mozzarella</I> on top of <iI>lasagna sauce.</iI> <CA>Add</CA> half of the <I>ricotta cheese,</I> by placing <I>cheese dollops</I> every 2 inches. <CA>Sprinkle</CA> grated <I>parmesan cheese</I> in thin even layer on top of <iI>ricotta cheese.</iI> 


<CA>Apply</CA> second layer of <I>noodles,</I> <CA>top</CA> it with half of the <iI>remaining sauce.</iI> <CA>Add</CA> half of the remaining <iI>Mozzarella</iI> and another thin sprinkling of <I>Parmesan.</I> <CA>Finish</CA> with another layer of <I>noodles.</I> <CA>Spread</CA> the <I>remaining sauce</I> over the top layer of <iI>noodles</iI> and <CA>sprinkle</CA> with the remaining <iI>Mozzarella cheese.</iI> 

<CA>Tent</CA> <U>lasagna pan</U> with aluminum foil <u>(not touching noodles or sauce). <CA>Bake</CA> at 375Â°F for 45 minutes. Allow to <CA>cool</CA> before serving. 

May be <CA>reheated</CA> in conventional <U>oven</U> or <U>microwave.</U> Leave <U>aluminum tent</U> on for storage. (Do not allow aluminum to touch the sauce, as it the acid may cause the aluminum to leach into the sauce.)

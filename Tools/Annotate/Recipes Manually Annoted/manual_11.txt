<CA>Wash</CA> the <I>rice</I> and <I>urad daal</I> well. <CA>Add</CA> the <I>fenugreek seeds</I> to the <iI>mix</iI> and <CA>fill</CA> enough <I>water</I> in the rice-daal <U>bowl</U> to cover them about 2" deep. <CA>Soak</CA> overnight. 

The next morning, <CA>drain</CA> all the <I>water</I> from the <I>rice</I> and <I>urad daal.</I> Now <CA>put</CA> some in a <U>food processor</U> and <CA>grind</CA> - <CA>adding</CA> very little <I>water</I> if necessary - to a smooth yet slightly grainy paste. 

When all the rice-daal mix is ground like this, <CA>put</CA> it into a large mixing <U>bowl</U> and <CA>add</CA> enough <I>water</I> to make a <iI>batter.</iI> The consistency of the <iI>batter</iI> should be such that it thickly coats a spoon dipped in it. 

Now <CA>add</CA> <I>salt</I> to taste and <CA>keep</CA> the Dosa <iI>batter</iI> aside in a warm, dark spot, covered, for 6-8 hours. After this fermentation, <CA>stir</CA> the <iI>batter</iI> well. It is now ready to make Dosas. 

<CA>Put</CA> some <I>cooking oil</I> in a small <U>bowl</U> and keep ready. You will also need a <U>bowl</U> of ice cold <I>water</I>, a large, <U>flat nonstick pan,</U> 2 <U>sheets of paper towel,</U> a <U>ladle,</U> a <U>spatula</U> and a <U>basting brush.</U> 

<CA>Fold</CA> one <U>sheet of paper towel</U> into a wad and <CA>dip</CA> lightly into the <U>bowl</U> of <I>cooking oil.</I> <CA>Squeeze out</CA> any excess and then <CA>rub</CA> the <U>paper towel</U> all over the surface of the <U>pan</U> to grease. The correct amount of <I>oil</I> is such that it is barely visible on the <U>pan.</U> Now <CA>turn on</CA> the heat/ flame at medium high. 

<CA>Fill</CA> the <U>ladle</U> upto the 3/4 level with Dosa <iI>batter.</iI> Gently <CA>pour</CA> this <iI>batter</iI> onto the center of the <U>pan</U> - just as you would for a pancake - till the <U>ladle</U> is empty. 

Now begin to <CA>spread</CA> the <iI>batter</iI> in sweeping circular motions to form a pancake of roughly 8" diameter. Do not be alarmed if the <iI>Dosa</iI> develops tiny holes as you spread the <iI>batter.</iI> This is normal. 

As soon as you have finished <CA>spreading</CA> the <iI>batter</iI> out on the <U>pan,</U> <CA>dip</CA> the <U>basting brush</U> in <I>cooking oil</I> and <CA>drizzle</CA> the <I>oil</I> all over the surface of the <iI>dosa</iI> and also around its edges. Now <CA>hold</CA> the <U>pan</U> by its handle, <CA>lift up</CA> and <CA>swirl</CA> it so as to make the drizzled <I>oil</I> spread all over the <iI>Dosa.</iI> 

When the upper surface begins to look cooked (it will no longer look soft or runny), <CA>flip</CA> the <iI>Dosa.</iI> By this time, ideally, the surface that was underneath should be light golden in color. Allow to <CA>cook</CA> for 1 minute after <CA>flipping</CA>. 

The <iI>Dosa</iI> is almost done. <CA>Fold</CA> it in half and allow to <CA>cook</CA> for 30 seconds more. 

<CA>Serve</CA> the ready <iI>Dosa</iI> with side dishes like South Indian <I>Coconut Chutney,</I> South Indian <I>Gunpowder Chutney</I> and <I>Sambar.</I> I like to <CA>make</CA> and <CA>serve</CA> Dosas immediately while I cook as this means they are crisp and fresh when eaten. This, however, is not absolutely necessary. You can also make, stack and <CA>serve</CA> the Dosas later. Just ensure you <CA>keep</CA> them warm till serving time by placing them - just like with pancakes - in a closed dish. 

Before you start making the next Dosa, <CA>fold</CA> another <U>sheet of paper towel</U> into a wad and <CA>dip</CA> it in ice cold <I>water.</I> <CA>Squeeze</CA> the wad to remove excess <I>water</I> and then <CA>rub</CA> it all over the surface of the <U>pan</U> to cool it slightly. This ensures your next Dosa will spread evenly and not break because the <U>pan</U> is too hot. Now proceed as you did for the last Dosa.

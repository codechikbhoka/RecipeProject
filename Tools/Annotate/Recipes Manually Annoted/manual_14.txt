After moistening the palms with a little <I>water</I> and <I>oil,</I> take enough quantity of the prepared Minced <I>Meat,</I> to make into a 2" to 3" diameter compact Ball. First <CA>press</CA> the Minced <I>Meat</I> in the right hand palm by fingers and thumb, and then <CA>roll</CA> between palms of both hands. <CA>Repeat</CA> the process. By <CA>dividing</CA> in the very beginning, the whole Minced <I>Meat</I> approximately into equal portions, <iI>Balls</iI> of uniform size will be made. 

For making a Seasoning of <I>Shallots</I> and <I>Onions,</I> <CA>cut</CA> the roots and tops of enough <I>Onions</I> and <I>Shallots,</I> to obtain half a cup of each, after <CA>peeling</CA> and <CA>chopping.</CA> For <CA>frying</CA> and making the Emulsion. Keep it aside in a <U>bowl</U> for use. 


<CA>Wash</CA> thoroughly the <I>Green Mint</I> or <I>Green Coriander</I> sprigs, after discarding coarse stems and bad leaves. <CA>Chop</CA> finely and keep aside in a plate also. 


<CA>Beat</CA> with a <U>spoon,</U> or <CA>chum</CA> with a small <U>Churning Stick</U> the <I>Curd,</I> in a steel or glass <U>bowl,</U> after adding the <I>Caraway Seeds.</I> 


<CA>Peel</CA> the <I>Garlic cloves</I> and <CA>chop</CA> these too. 

In a round bottomed, tinned copper or a heavy steel <U>'Patila'</U> or <U>'Degchi'</U> of about 3 litres capacity, <CA>boil</CA> the prepared Minced <iI>Meat Balls,</iI> in sufficient <I>water</I> to <CA>immerse</CA> these wholly. Before boiling starts, <CA>add</CA> to the <I>water</I> the <I>Salt</I> and the <I>Aniseed</I> and <I>Ginger Powders.</I> After half an hour <CA>remove</CA> the <U>pot</U> from heat and <CA>strain</CA> the <iI>Soup</iI> in a <U>bowl,</U> and keep the boiled <iI>Meat Balls</iI> separately in a plate. Discard the residue left after straining and clean the cooking vessel. 

<CA>Heat</CA> the <I>Oil</I> in the <U>vessel</U> till foam disappears. Add <I>'Ghi',</I> <I>Cloves</I> and chopped <I>Garlic.</I> <CA>Stir</CA> again and <CA>add</CA> the prepared <I>Curd</I> and the <iI>Soup</iI> thoroughly mixed together. Go on <CA>stirring</CA> with a steel or wooden <U>ladle,</U> so that the <I>Curd</I> does not crack. When the <I>Oil,</I> <I>'Ghi',</I> <I>Curd</I> and <iI>Soup</iI> <CA>boil</CA> and <CA>blend</CA> nicely, <CA>add</CA> the boiled Minced <iI>Meat Balls,</iI> and the <I>Onion</I> and <I>Shallot</I> Seasoning. Let <CA>cook</CA> on a low heat till the <iI>Gravy</iI> becomes somewhat thick and oil and <I>'Ghi'</I> begins to show. 


Now <CA>add</CA> the <I>'Garam Masala',</I> <I>Cinnamon</I> and <I>Black Cardamom Powder,</I> the slightly crushed <I>Green Cardamoms</I> and the finely chopped <I>Green Mint</I> or <I>Green Coriander Leaves.</I> Turn the <iI>Balls</iI> with a broad steel <U>spatula</U> and the 'Goashtaba' is ready to be served hot, along with a ladleful of it delicious Gravy. 

In case <I>Green Mint</I> or <I>Green Coriander Leaves</I> are not available Dried crushed, and preserved Mint Leaves, may be used.

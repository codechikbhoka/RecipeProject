Preheat oven to 275 degrees F. 
Using a knife, remove the thick inner stems from the leaves, leaving long strips; cut the strips in half. Arrange the leaves dark side up in a single layer on two baking sheets. 
Lightly mist each piece with <I>olive oil spray.</I> Sprinkle generously and evenly with <I>Parmesan cheese.</I> 
Bake about 14-16 minutes, until the leaves are <I>crisp</I> and the <I>cheese</I> is lightly golden. Sometimes the leaves bake unevenly, so watch them carefully, removing the <I>crisp</I> ones as they are done and returning the others to continue baking until done. Serve warm.

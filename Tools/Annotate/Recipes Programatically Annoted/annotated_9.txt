Cut the <I>eggplants</I> into 1-inch pieces- preferably keeping at least one side of each piece with the skin on. 
Put the <I>eggplant</I> pieces into a strainer and sprinkle liberally with <I>salt.</I> Place a small plate on top of the <I>eggplant,</I> and a weight on top of the plate- this process draws the excess <I>water</I> out of the <I>eggplant,</I> and it won't be overly salty. Leave for at least 30 minutes. 
Heat 1 1/2 tbsp <I>oil</I> in a heavy pan. When hot, add <I>mustard seeds-</I> they will start to pop in a few seconds. When they begin to pop, add the <I>sliced</I> <I>onions,</I> <I>garlic</I> and <I>ginger.</I> Turn the heat to medium, and cook until mixture is nicely <I>browned.</I> 
Add <I>cayenne pepper,</I> <I>tumeric,</I> <I>garam masala</I> and <I>cumin</I> to the <I>onion</I> mixture. Cook <I>spices</I> for a few minutes, then add <I>water</I> and <I>tomato paste,</I> and reduce heat to low. Let the <I>sauce</I> cook gently, but don't allow it to become dry. 
In a large skillet, heat 1 1/2 tbsp <I>oil</I> over moderate heat. Add <I>eggplant</I> pieces to the pan, and arrange in a single layer. Saute until all sides are <I>brown</I> and <I>crisp.</I> 
Once all <I>eggplant</I> pieces are <I>browned,</I> incorporate them into the <I>sauce</I> pan, making sure to cover all pieces with the <I>sauce.</I> Add <I>lemon juice</I> and <I>salt.</I> 
Cook gently until <I>eggplant</I> is cooked through (about 15-20 minutes). Stir occasionally (and very gently) and serve.

in the large bowl of a heavy duty electric mixer (such as a kitchen aid) add the <I>warm water</I> sprinkle on the <I>yeast</I> and let sit for 5 minutes until the <I>yeast</I> is dissolved stir to dissolve completely if needed at the end of 5 minutes 
attach a mixing paddle to the mixer mix in the <I>olive oil</I> <I>flour</I> <I>salt</I> and <I>sugar</I> on low speed for about a minute remove the mixing paddle and replace with a <I>dough</I> hook knead using the mixer and <I>dough</I> hook on low to medium speed until the <I>dough</I> is smooth and elastic about 10 minutes if you don't have a mixer you can mix and knead by <I>hand</I> if the <I>dough</I> seems a little too wet sprinkle on a bit more <I>flour</I> 
place ball of <I>dough</I> in a bowl that has been coated lightly with <I>olive oil</I> turn the <I>dough</I> around in the bowl so that it gets coated with the <I>oil</I> cover with <I>plastic wrap</I> let sit in a warm place (75-85°f) until it doubles in size about 1 to 1 1/2 hours (or several hours longer a longer rise will improve the flavor) if you don't have a warm spot in the house you can heat the oven to 150 degrees and then turn off the oven let the oven cool till it is just a little warm then place the bowl of <I>dough</I> in this warmed oven to rise 
at this point if you want to make ahead you can freeze the <I>dough</I> in an airtight container for up to two weeks 
preparing the pizzas 
place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven preheat the oven to 450°f for at least 30 minutes preferably an hour 
remove the plastic cover from the <I>dough</I> and punch the <I>dough</I> down so it deflates a bit divide the <I>dough</I> in half form two <I>round</I> balls of <I>dough</I> place each in its own bowl cover with plastic and let sit for 10 minutes 
prepare your desired toppings note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the <I>crust</I> will end up not <I>crisp</I> that way about a third a cup each of <I>tomato sauce</I> and <I>cheese</I> would be sufficient for one pizza one to two <I>mushrooms</I> thinly <I>sliced</I> will cover a pizza 
working one ball of <I>dough</I> at a time take one ball of <I>dough</I> and flatten it with your <I>hands</I> on a slightly floured work surface starting at the center and working outwards use your fingertips to press the <I>dough</I> to 1/2-inch thick turn and stretch the <I>dough</I> until it will not stretch further let the <I>dough</I> relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter - 10 to 12 inches use your palm to flatten the edge of the <I>dough</I> where it is thicker you can pinch the very edges if you want to form a lip 
brush the top of the <I>dough</I> with <I>olive oil</I> (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings) use your finger tips to press down and make dents along the surface of the <I>dough</I> to prevent bubbling let rest another 5 minutes 
repeat with the second ball of <I>dough</I> 
lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with <I>corn</I> <I>meal</I> transfer one prepared flattened <I>dough</I> to the pizza peel if the <I>dough</I> has lost its shape in the transfer lightly shape it to the desired dimensions 
spoon on the <I>tomato sauce</I> sprinkle with <I>cheese</I> and place your desired toppings on the pizza 
sprinkle some <I>cornmeal</I> on the baking stone in the oven (watch your <I>hands</I> the oven is hot!) gently shake the peel to see if the <I>dough</I> will easily slide if not gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more <I>cornmeal</I> slide the pizza off of the peel and on to the baking stone in the oven bake pizza one at a time until the <I>crust</I> is <I>browned</I> and the <I>cheese</I> is golden about 10-15 minutes if you want toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more <I>cheese</I>

Start by putting your tenderloins in the slow cooker. Pour the <I>beer</I> on them and put the slow cooker on high for 6 to 8 hours. 
When the <I>meat</I> is ready, turn off the slow cooker and transfer the <I>meat</I> to a carving board and pull the <I>meat</I> apart with 2 forks to create pulled <I>pork.</I> Take out <I>any</I> pieces of <I>fat</I> from the slow cooker and put the <I>pork</I> back in it's <I>juices</I> and cover. 
Heat up your oven to 400 degrees F. 
In a small saucepan, heat <I>milk,</I> <I>water</I> and <I>butter</I> until very warm, 120 degrees F (50 degrees C). Transfer into a bowl, sprinkle the <I>yeast</I> on top and let it sit for 10 minutes. 
In a large bowl, mix together 1 3/4 cup <I>flour,</I> <I>sugar</I> and <I>salt.</I> Mix <I>milk</I> mixture into <I>flour</I> mixture, and then mix in <I>egg.</I> Stir in the remaining <I>flour,</I> 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. 
When the <I>dough</I> has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. 
Divide <I>dough</I> into 24 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking sheet. Flatten slightly. Cover, and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes. 
Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for about 10 minutes, or until golden <I>brown.</I> 
While the <I>buns</I> are cooling a bit, mix in your <I>BBQ sauce</I> with your <I>pork.</I> 
Slice your <I>slider buns</I> in half, put a bit of the <I>pork,</I> a bit of <I>cheese</I> (a strong <I>cheddar</I> would be good) and a bit of <I>cilantro.</I> 
Enjoy!

1 In a grinder grind the <I>onions,</I> <I>ginger,</I> 2 <I>bay leaves,</I> <I>red</I> <I>chili,</I> <I>mustard seeds,</I> <I>cumin seed</I> all together. 

2 Preserve some cut pieces 1 cup) of <I>onion.</I> 

3 Cut small pieces of <I>tomatoes.</I> 

4 Make small pieces of <I>fish fillets,</I> about 3 inches in length. 

5 Clean them properly if you are using the whole <I>fish</I> and make it into small pieces. 

6 Take a big plate, put the <I>fish</I> in it and sprinkle 2 teaspoon of <I>salt,</I> two teaspoon of <I>turmeric</I> powder and the <I>garlic paste.</I> 

7 Mix all of them properly. 

8 Allow to marinate for 1/2 hour. 

9 Take a pan or a wok (preferable), heat it and put <I>oil</I> to deep fry the <I>fish.</I> 

10 Once the <I>oil</I> is much hotter, fry the <I>fish,</I> 3-4 pieces at a time, 3-4 minutes on each side. 

11 Keep all of them in a separate plate. 

12 When all the pieces are fried, clean all the <I>black</I> residues from the <I>oil</I> in the wok with the spatula and put 2 tablespoon of fresh <I>oil</I> in the it. 

13 Then put a pinch of <I>cumin seed,</I> a pinch of <I>mustard seed,</I> 2 <I>red</I> <I>chili,</I> 2 <I>bay leaves,</I> a pinch of <I>aniseed</I> (all together is called panch-phoran) and allow them to splutter. 

14 Then put the cut <I>onion</I> pieces and allow it to just a little <I>brown.</I> 

15 Then put all the ground paste, <I>tomatoes,</I> left over <I>turmeric</I> powder and <I>salt</I> to taste. 

16 Keep stirring it until the paste becomes a little <I>brown</I> (it takes around 10 minutes). 

17 You can also identify it by looking at the wok, that the paste will start leaving the <I>oil</I> and paste will now no more stick on the wok. 

18 The paste is now perfectly fried. 

19 Now pour 3 cups of <I>water</I> to it, or as much thick <I>gravy</I> you want. 

20 Once the <I>gravy</I> comes to boil, start dropping the fried <I>fish</I> pieces and allow to boil for 15 minutes. 

21 Switch off the gas. 

22 Use <I>coriander</I> leaf for garnishing. 

23 This dish should be served with fresh steamed <I>rice</I> and squeeze some <I>lime juice</I> on top.

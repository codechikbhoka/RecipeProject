put a large pot of <I>salted</I> <I>water</I> (1 tbsp <I>salt</I> for every 2 quarts of <I>water)</I> on the stovetop on high heat it can take a while for a large pot of <I>water</I> to come to a boil (this will be your <I>pasta</I> <I>water)</I> so prepare the <I>sauce</I> in the next steps while the <I>water</I> is heating 
heat about a teaspoon or so of <I>olive oil</I> in a large skillet on medium high heat add the <I>lean ground beef</I> and cook it in the skillet until lightly <I>browned</I> and cooked through put a few layers of paper towels in large bowl with slotted spoon remove the <I>browned</I> <I>beef</I> from the skillet draining off the excess <I>beef</I> <I>fat</I> and put the <I>browned</I> <I>beef</I> on top of the paper towels to help blot away the excess <I>fat</I> after you have removed all the <I>browned</I> <I>beef</I> from the skillet drain off and dispose of excess <I>fat</I> (if your <I>ground beef</I> is sufficiently lean there won't be <I>any</I> excess <I>fat</I> to drain) 
add the diced <I>bell pepper</I> and <I>onions</I> to skillet (in the photo we are using <I>yellow bell pepper</I> and <I>red onions)</I> <I>brown</I> for a few minutes on medium high heat add the <I>minced garlic</I> and cook for 30 seconds more add the <I>browned</I> <I>beef</I> back to the skillet lower the heat to low and continue to cook for 5 more minutes stirring frequently 
transfer <I>browned</I> <I>beef</I> <I>bell peppers</I> and <I>onions</I> to a medium sized (3 to 4 quart) pot add the <I>tomato sauce</I> <I>tomato paste</I> and <I>crushed tomatoes</I> add <I>oregano</I> <I>parsley</I> <I>italian seasoning</I> adjust amounts to taste add a pinch of <I>garlic powder</I> and/or a pinch of <I>garlic salt</I> to taste add a splash of <I>red</I> or <I>white wine vinegar</I> add <I>sugar</I> a tablespoon at a time until desired level of sweetness no more than 1/4 cup of <I>sugar</I> note that it is hard to follow a pure recipe when it comes to <I>pasta sauce</I> one italian <I>spice</I> mix is not like the <I>other</I> nor is one can of <I>tomato sauce</I> like another so you really do need to taste the <I>sauce</I> as you are adding the <I>spices</I> <I>sugar</I> and <I>vinegar</I> and adjust for your preference add <I>salt</I> to taste and note that you will later be adding <I>parmesan</I> which is salty 
bring the <I>sauce</I> to a simmer and lower the heat to low to maintain a low simmer cook for 15-45 minutes to thicken (do not scorch bottom stir frequently) remove from heat 
by now the <I>salted</I> <I>water</I> you started heating in step one should be boiling add the dry <I>lasagna noodles</I> and cook then per package directions <I>(al</I> dente) (note <I>noodles</I> may be cooked in advance) stir often to prevent from sticking make sure that <I>water</I> remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent <I>noodles</I> from sticking when ready drain in a colander and rinse with cool <I>water</I> gently separating <I>any</I> <I>noodles</I> that may be sticking together spread a little <I>olive oil</I> on a large rimmed baking sheet and lay out the cooked <I>noodles</I> on this sheet turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the <I>olive oil</I> this will prevent them from sticking together 
in a 13x9x2-inch casserole or lasagna dish ladle one cup of <I>sauce</I> and spread it along the bottom of the pan apply one layer <I>noodles</I> 3 length wise (edge may overlap depending on your pan) ladle a third of the remaining <I>sauce</I> over the <I>noodles</I> apply a layer of a third of the <I>mozzarella</I> on top of lasagna <I>sauce</I> add half of the <I>ricotta cheese</I> by placing <I>cheese</I> dollops every 2 inches sprinkle <I>grated parmesan cheese</I> in thin even layer on top of <I>ricotta cheese</I> 
apply second layer of <I>noodles</I> top it with half of the remaining <I>sauce</I> add half of the remaining <I>mozzarella</I> and another thin sprinkling of <I>parmesan</I> finish with another layer of <I>noodles</I> spread the remaining <I>sauce</I> over the top layer of <I>noodles</I> and sprinkle with the remaining <I>mozzarella cheese</I> 
tent lasagna pan with <I>aluminum foil</I> (not touching <I>noodles</I> or <I>sauce)</I> bake at 375Â°f for 45 minutes allow to cool before serving 
may be reheated in conventional oven or microwave leave aluminum tent on for storage (do not allow aluminum to touch the <I>sauce</I> as it the acid may cause the aluminum to leach into the <I>sauce)</I>

Peel the <I>kiwifruit</I> and dice into pieces approximately 1/2 inch. 
Peel the <I>mango</I> and cut into pieces the same size as the <I>kiwi.</I> 
Cut up <I>cucumbers</I> in pieces the same size as <I>kiwifruit</I> and <I>mango.</I> I had small <I>cucumbers</I> with thin skins, but if you're using larger <I>cucumbers</I> I would peel or partially peel them. 
Thinly slice the <I>green onions.</I> 
Mix fresh squeezed <I>lime juice</I> with just a touch of <I>green</I> <I>Tabasco sauce,</I> or you could use a couple of small <I>jalapenos,</I> finely diced if you don't have the <I>green</I> <I>Tabasco.</I> 
Mix all the ingredients together and it's done. You can chill for a few hours, or serve at room temperature.

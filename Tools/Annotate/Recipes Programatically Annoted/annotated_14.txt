After moistening the palms with a little <I>water</I> and <I>oil,</I> take enough quantity of the prepared Minced <I>Meat,</I> to make into a 2" to 3" diameter compact Ball. First press the Minced <I>Meat</I> in the right <I>hand</I> palm by fingers and thumb, and then <I>roll</I> between palms of both <I>hands.</I> Repeat the process. By dividing in the very beginning, the whole Minced <I>Meat</I> approximately into equal portions, Balls of uniform size will be made. 

For making a <I>Seasoning</I> of <I>Shallots</I> and <I>Onions,</I> cut the roots and tops of enough <I>Onions</I> and <I>Shallots,</I> to obtain half a cup of each, after peeling and chopping. For frying and making the Emulsion. Keep it aside in a bowl for use. 


Wash thoroughly the <I>Green</I> <I>Mint</I> or <I>Green</I> <I>Coriander</I> sprigs, after discarding coarse stems and bad leaves. Chop finely and keep aside in a plate also.

In a <I>round</I> bottomed, tinned copper or a heavy steel 'Patila' or 'Degchi' of about 3 litres capacity, boil the prepared Minced <I>Meat</I> Balls, in sufficient <I>water</I> to immerse these wholly. Before boiling starts, add to the <I>water</I> the <I>Salt</I> and the <I>Aniseed</I> and <I>Ginger</I> Powders. After half an hour remove the pot from heat and strain the <I>Soup</I> in a bowl, and keep the boiled <I>Meat</I> Balls separately in a plate. Discard the residue left after straining and clean the cooking vessel. 

Heat the <I>Oil</I> in the vessel till foam disappears. Add 'Ghi', <I>Cloves</I> and <I>chopped Garlic.</I> Stir again and add the prepared <I>Curd</I> and the <I>Soup</I> thoroughly mixed together. Go on stirring with a steel or wooden ladle, so that the <I>Curd</I> does not crack. When the <I>Oil,</I> 'Ghi', <I>Curd</I> and <I>Soup</I> boil and blend nicely, add the boiled Minced <I>Meat</I> Balls, and the <I>Onion</I> and <I>Shallot</I> <I>Seasoning.</I> Let cook on a low heat till the <I>Gravy</I> becomes somewhat thick and <I>oil</I> and 'Ghi' begins to show. 


Now add the <I>'Garam Masala',</I> <I>Cinnamon</I> and <I>Black</I> <I>Cardamom</I> Powder, the slightly <I>crushed</I> <I>Green</I> Cardamoms and the <I>finely chopped</I> <I>Green</I> <I>Mint</I> or <I>Green</I> <I>Coriander</I> Leaves. Turn the Balls with a broad steel spatula and the 'Goashtaba' is ready to be served hot, along with a ladleful of it delicious <I>Gravy.</I>

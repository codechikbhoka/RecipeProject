put a large pot of <U>salted</U> <U>water</U> (1 tbsp <U>salt</U> for every 2 quarts of <U>water)</U> on the stovetop on high heat it can take a while for a large pot of <U>water</U> to come to a boil (this will be your <U>pasta</U> <U>water)</U> so prepare the <U>sauce</U> in the next steps while the water is heating 
heat about a teaspoon or so of <U>olive oil</U> in a large skillet on medium high heat add the <U>lean ground beef</U> and cook it in the skillet until lightly <U>browned</U> and cooked through put a few layers of paper towels in large bowl with slotted spoon remove the <U>browned</U> <U>beef</U> from the skillet draining off the excess <U>beef</U> <U>fat</U> and put the <U>browned</U> <U>beef</U> on top of the paper towels to help blot away the excess <U>fat</U> after you have removed all the <U>browned</U> <U>beef</U> from the skillet drain off and dispose of excess <U>fat</U> (if your <U>ground beef</U> is sufficiently lean there won't be <U>any</U> excess <U>fat</U> to drain) 
add the diced <U>bell pepper</U> and <U>onions</U> to skillet (in the photo we are using <U>yellow bell pepper</U> and <U>red onions)</U> <U>brown</U> for a few minutes on medium high heat add the <U>minced garlic</U> and cook for 30 seconds more add the <U>browned</U> <U>beef</U> back to the skillet lower the heat to low and continue to cook for 5 more minutes stirring frequently 
transfer <U>browned</U> <U>beef</U> <U>bell peppers</U> and <U>onions</U> to a medium sized (3 to 4 quart) pot add the <U>tomato sauce</U> <U>tomato paste</U> and <U>crushed tomatoes</U> add <U>oregano</U> <U>parsley</U> <U>italian seasoning</U> adjust amounts to taste add a pinch of <U>garlic powder</U> and/or a pinch of <U>garlic salt</U> to taste add a splash of <U>red</U> or <U>white wine vinegar</U> add <U>sugar</U> a tablespoon at a time until desired level of sweetness no more than 1/4 cup of <U>sugar</U> note that it is hard to follow a pure recipe when it comes to <U>pasta sauce</U> one italian <U>spice</U> mix is not like the <U>other</U> nor is one can of <U>tomato sauce</U> like another so you really do need to taste the <U>sauce</U> as you are adding the <U>spices</U> <U>sugar</U> and <U>vinegar</U> and adjust for your preference add <U>salt</U> to taste and note that you will later be adding <U>parmesan</U> which is salty 
bring the <U>sauce</U> to a simmer and lower the heat to low to maintain a low simmer cook for 15-45 minutes to thicken (do not scorch bottom stir frequently) remove from heat 
by now the <U>salted</U> <U>water</U> you started heating in step one should be boiling add the dry <U>lasagna noodles</U> and cook then per package directions <U>(al</U> dente) (note <U>noodles</U> may be cooked in advance) stir often to prevent from sticking make sure that <U>water</U> remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent <U>noodles</U> from sticking when ready drain in a colander and rinse with cool <U>water</U> gently separating <U>any</U> <U>noodles</U> that may be sticking together spread a little <U>olive oil</U> on a large rimmed baking sheet and lay out the cooked <U>noodles</U> on this sheet turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the <U>olive oil</U> this will prevent them from sticking together 
in a 13x9x2-inch casserole or lasagna dish ladle one cup of <U>sauce</U> and spread it along the bottom of the pan apply one layer <U>noodles</U> 3 length wise (edge may overlap depending on your pan) ladle a third of the remaining <U>sauce</U> over the <U>noodles</U> apply a layer of a third of the <U>mozzarella</U> on top of lasagna <U>sauce</U> add half of the <U>ricotta cheese</U> by placing <U>cheese</U> dollops every 2 inches sprinkle <U>grated parmesan cheese</U> in thin even layer on top of <U>ricotta cheese</U> 
apply second layer of <U>noodles</U> top it with half of the remaining <U>sauce</U> add half of the remaining <U>mozzarella</U> and another thin sprinkling of <U>parmesan</U> finish with another layer of <U>noodles</U> spread the remaining <U>sauce</U> over the top layer of <U>noodles</U> and sprinkle with the remaining <U>mozzarella cheese</U> 
tent lasagna pan with <U>aluminum foil</U> (not touching <U>noodles</U> or <U>sauce)</U> bake at 375Â°f for 45 minutes allow to cool before serving 
may be reheated in conventional oven or microwave leave aluminum tent on for storage (do not allow aluminum to touch the <U>sauce</U> as it the acid may cause the aluminum to leach into the <U>sauce)</U>
